# Suicide-and-Mental-Health-Data-Analysis
This project aims to analyze the correlation between mental health issues, suicide rates, and social support by country from 2015 to 2022. We've built a data warehouse to facilitate complex analyses and support efforts in mental health improvement and suicide prevention.
